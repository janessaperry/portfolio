            InStock was originally a group project completed during a bootcamp where I learned some key
            aspects of collaborative development, such as Git flow, resolving merge conflicts, and using Jira
            to stay organized.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating, I decided to rebuild the web app on my own to gain more hands-on experience
            with some of the areas that I didnâ€™t get to work on the first time around. This also gave me the
            chance to switch up the tech stack a bit and implement some additional features such as:

            <li>Building custom form inputs that meet accessibility guidelines</li>
            <li>Centralized error handling and logging</li>
            <li>Automated database reseeding</li>
            <li>Protecting API routes with rate limiting</li>

          <p>Rebuilding this project gave me a much deeper understanding of full stack development and how all the
            moving parts fit together. It also gave me a chance to slow down and ask better questions. On the backend,
            that meant learning how to structure a codebase that's easy to maintain and debug. On the frontend, I
            explored custom UI elements and accessibility considerations that I haven't done before.
